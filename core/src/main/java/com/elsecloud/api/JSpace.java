/**
 * core interface of the system which encapsulates concept of tuple spaces.
 * 
 * </p> Object Spaces is a paradigm for development of distributed computing
 * applications. All the participants of the distributed application share an
 * Object Space. A provider of a service encapsulates the service as an Object,
 * and puts it in the Object Space. Clients of a service then access the Object
 * Space, find out which object provides the needed service, and have the
 * request serviced by the object. Object Spaces, as a computing paradigm, was
 * put forward by David Gelernter at Yale University. Gelernter developed a
 * language called Linda to support the concept of global object coordination.
 * Object Space can be thought of as a virtual repository, shared amongst
 * providers and accessors of network services, which are themselves abstracted
 * as objects. Processes communicate among each other using these shared objects
 * â€” by updating the state of the objects as and when needed. An object, when
 * deposited into a space, needs to be registered with an Object Directory in
 * the Object Space. Any processes can then identify the object from the Object
 * Directory, using properties lookup, where the property specifying the
 * criteria for the lookup of the object is its name or some other property
 * which uniquely identifies it. A process may choose to wait for an object to
 * be placed in the Object Space, if the needed object is not already present.
 * Objects, when deposited in an Object Space are passive, i.e., their methods
 * cannot be invoked while the objects are in the Object Space. Instead, the
 * accessing process must retrieve it from the Object Space into its local
 * memory, use the service provided by the object, update the state of the
 * object and place it back into the Object Space. This paradigm inherently
 * provides mutual exclusion. Because once an object is accessed, it has to be
 * removed from the Object Space, and is placed back only after it has been
 * released. This means that no other process can access an object while it is
 * being used by one process, thereby ensuring mutual exclusion.</p>
 * 
 * There are 5 basic methods allowing you to interact with the Objects Space:
 * write, read, take, update, notify. Instead of re-usage of JINI JavaSpaces
 * API, this interface is being created. And of course there are number of
 * reasons:
 * <ul>
 * <li>jini itself is almost dead project and there is only one commercial successor - Gigaspaces with actual
 * implementation far away from just space concepts.</li>
 * <li>Javaspace API forces to use JINI - which is actually something we are trying to omit</li>
 * <li>JINI is not installed with JRE and requires additional application dependencies</li>
 * <li>instead of using JINI API, spring transaction and DAO exception abstraction to be reused</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * </p>
 * <strong>NOTE:</strong> that space interactions could be executed under transactions. Typically you would use Spring's
 * transactions abstraction and configure transaction point-cuts via AOP
 * (AspectJ or just Spring AOP) via spring configuration file or {@link Transactional} Transactional annotations.
